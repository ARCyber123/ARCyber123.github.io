    <h1 style="padding-top: 25px;">Why You Should Consider Linux</h1>
    <p>Linux is an operating system kernel (the kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating
        system with complete control over everything in the system. It is an integral part of any operating system.
        It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory"). It is
        one of the least used desktop operating systems right now (yes, I'm using Linux).
        But if it's something to consider, why do people use it less? Why <em>should</em> you consider it? Find out
        here!</p>
    <h2>Why you should consider Linux</h2>
    <h3>1. Security</h3>
    <p>Linux is secure because... it's not widely used!
        What that means is, viruses and hackers target Windows because it's used a lot more and there's
        more chance of the virus hitting their target. Not to say Windows is insecure, though. Microsoft is doing their
        best to provide good security. Here's an analogy: You have to shoot one of two targets. One is a lot
        bigger and one is a lot smaller. Whichever you shoot, you get the same outcome. So, you would rather shoot
        the bigger target, because there's more chance of hitting it. That's what viruses and hackers would
        choose, too. Linux is a small target, while Windows is the bigger one.</p><img src="/images/gufw.png" alt="gufw" title="GUFW (Graphical Uncomplicated Firewall), a firewall for Linux" class="image">
    <h3>2. Performance</h3>
    <p>Linux works on almost <strong>anything!</strong> There's even a toaster that runs on Linux. Linux is faster
        because
        Linux usually has a lot lesser/smaller background services than Windows. Background services are the programs
        that
        don't have any content that is supposed to be shown to you, and they do tasks like reporting errors, etc.</p>

    <h3>3. Variety</h3>
    <p>Linux has a large variety of "distros", which are actually just operating systems with the Linux kernel.
        So, you can choose whichever distro you like (in case you want to know, I'm using Manjaro).</p>

    <p>Linux also has a variety of Desktop Environments, which have different features and look-and-feels. (I am using
        the KDE Plasma edition of Manjaro).</p>
    <p>There are more advantages, but I've covered the bigger ones here. Now let's see why Linux isn't popular.</p>
    <h2>Why is Linux used lesser?</h2>
    <p>Linux is definitely something to consider, but it isn't popular. This is because it just hasn't gained momentum yet, and also because computers usually come pre-installed with Windows and people don't want to take
        the effort to switch over.</p><img src="/images/osshare.png" alt="OS Market Share 2019" class="image">
    <h3>The only disadvantage (in my opinion)</h3>
    <p>The only problem about Linux (in my opinion!) is the <strong>compatibility.</strong> This means that some Windows
        files won't work in Linux, and also that Linux doesn't have many applications.</p>
