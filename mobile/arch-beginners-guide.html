    <p>This is a guide for someone who has not used Arch Linux before and teaches the must-knows
        of Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions. I use Manjaro, which is based on Arch.<br><img

    <h2>Pacman</h2>
    <p>Pacman is the default command-line package manager for Arch and its derivatives.
        Here are the common Pacman commands (make sure you match lowercase and uppercase, and replace
        <var>package-name</var> with the actual name of the package!):
        <h3>Install a package or packages by name:</h3>
        "sudo" or superuser privileges are required to install, remove or upgrade packages.<br>
        <code>sudo pacman -S <var>package-name</var></code><br>
        After typing this, type in your password for the superuser privileges and press enter.
        You will be asked for a confirmation, so type "y" for yes and press enter to proceed.
        To cancel, type "n" for no and press enter.
        <h3>Remove a package or packages by name:</h3>
        <code>sudo pacman -Rs <var>package-name</var></code><br>
        Just like while installing, you will be asked for the password and confirmation.
        <h3>Searching for packages</h3>
        Searching is essential if you don't know the name of the package. Superuser privileges are
        not required, since you are not making any changes to your computer. This searches the name
        and description of the packages.<br>
        <code>pacman -Ss <var>search-query</var></code><br>
        The output of this command will be:<br>
        <code><var>repository-name/package-name package-version</var><br>
            Description of package.</code>
        <h3>Upgrading packages and system:</h3>
        The same command is enough to check for updates, download package updates, install package updates
        and upgrade the system:<br>
        <code>sudo pacman -Syu</code>
        <h2>Managing packages the graphical way</h2>
        <p>Ubuntu and Fedora have "rpm" or "deb" files to install packages. Arch, on the other hand, is
            a little different. Everything is in one of its repositories. If you don't find what you're looking
            for in the repositories, it will likely be in the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org">Arch User Repository
            </a>.</p>
        <h3>Building packages from Tarballs</h3>
        <p> You can also build packages by downloading a tar.gz file from the Internet. Once it is downloaded, extract
            the archive. In case you didn't know, these files are compressed archives just like .zip files. Open the
            extracted folder. You will see a file called "PKGBUILD". If you don't, you probably downloaded the source
            code of the package instead. Now, right click in the empty part of the folder, and click "Open in terminal".
            If you're using KDE Dolphin, click the menu button on the top-right of the window and click "Open terminal".
            You can also do this with the <code>cd</code> command - type in the terminal: <code>cd
                /PATH/TO/FOLDER</code>
            (don't forget to replace it with the location of the folder, example
            <code>/home/user/Downloads/package-folder
            </code>). Now type the command: <code>makepkg -si</code> and your package will install.</p>
