    <h1 style="padding-top:20px;">Why You Should Consider Linux</h1>
    <p>Linux is an operating system kernel (the kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating
        system with complete control over everything in the system. It is an integral part of any operating system.
        It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory"). It is 
        one of the least used operating systems right now. But if it's something to consider, why does nobody
        use it? Why <em>should</em> you consider it? Find out here!</p>
    <h2>Why you should consider Linux</h2>
    <h3>1. Security</h3>
    <p>Linux is secure <em>mainly</em> against hacking and viruses because... it's not widely used!
    What that means is, viruses and hackers target Windows users because it's used a lot more and there's 
    more chance of the virus hitting their target. Not to say Windows is insecure, though. Microsoft is doing their
    best to provide good security. Here's an analogy: You have to shoot one of two targets. One is a lot
    bigger and one is a lot smaler. Whichever you shoot, you get the same outcome. So, you would rather shoot
    the bigger target, because there's more chance of hitting it. That's what viruses and hackers would
    choose, too. Linux is the small target, while Windows is the bigger one.</p>
    <h3>2. Performance</h3>
    <p>Linux works on almost <strong>anything!</strong> There's even a toaster that runs on Linux. Linux is faster because
    Linux usually has a lot lesser/smaller background services than Windows. Background services are the programs that
    don't have any content that is supposed to be shown to you, and they do tasks like reporting errors.</p>
