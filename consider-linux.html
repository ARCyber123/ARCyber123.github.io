    <h1 style="padding-top:20px;">Why You Should Consider Linux</h1>
    <p>Linux is an operating system kernel (the kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating
        system with complete control over everything in the system. It is an integral part of any operating system.
        It is the "portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory"). It is 
		one of the least used desktop operating systems right now (yes, I'm using Linux).
		But if it's something to consider, why do people use it less? Why <em>should</em> you consider it? Find out here!</p>
    <h2>Why you should consider Linux</h2>
    <h3>1. Security</h3>
    <p>Linux is secure <em>mainly</em> against hacking and viruses because... it's not widely used!
    What that means is, viruses and hackers target Windows users because it's used a lot more and there's 
    more chance of the virus hitting their target. Not to say Windows is insecure, though. Microsoft is doing their
    best to provide good security. Here's an analogy: You have to shoot one of two targets. One is a lot
    bigger and one is a lot smaller. Whichever you shoot, you get the same outcome. So, you would rather shoot
    the bigger target, because there's more chance of hitting it. That's what viruses and hackers would
	choose, too. Linux is the small target, while Windows is the bigger one.</p><img src="images/gufw.png" width="50%" alt="gufw">
    <h3>2. Performance</h3>
    <p>Linux works on almost <strong>anything!</strong> There's even a toaster that runs on Linux. Linux is faster because
    Linux usually has a lot lesser/smaller background services than Windows. Background services are the programs that
	don't have any content that is supposed to be shown to you, and they do tasks like reporting errors.</p>

	<h3>3. Variety</h3>
	<p>Linux has a large variety of "distros", which are actually just operating systems with the Linux kernel.
		So, you can choose whichever distro you like (in case you want to know, I'm using Kubuntu).</p>
		<img src="https://kubuntu.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/53ec/FocalPlasma-1024x578.png" width="60%" alt="Kubuntu"> 
		<p>Linux also has a variety of Desktop Environments, which have different features and look-and-feels. (Kubuntu uses
		the KDE Plasma Desktop Environment).</p>
	<p>There are a few more positives, but I've covered the bigger ones here. Now let's see why Linux isn't popular.</p>
	<h2>Why is Linux used lesser?</h2>
	<p>Linux is definetely something to consider, but it isn't popular. This is because it just hasn't gained
		momentum yet, and also because computers usually come pre-installed with Windows and people don't want to take
		the effort to switch over.</p><img src="images/osshare.png" width="60%" alt="OS Market Share 2019">
	<h3>The only negative (in my opinion)</h3>
	<p>The only problem about Linux (in my opinion!) is the <strong>compatibility.</strong> This means that some Windows
	files won't work in Linux, and also that Linux doesn't have many applications.</p>
